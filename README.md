# 📑 Techincal Contents

<!-- TOC -->
<h4>We used with this program fast dataStructers in searcing , adding , getting and editing data </h4>

***Important ::: note that the admin userId->1111 and the password->admin


* [📑 We have two Interfaces one for users and one for Admin and  ofcourse the login/Singup interface.](#-)

* [💻 We used slideBars for swtiching between panes with cool methods. ](#-)

* [💻For the users and the Books objects we used TreeMaps.](#-)

* [📑HashMap with (key,value)->(Integer,LinkedList<>) to make a relation between users and the books they purchased.](#)
* [💻we dont have the ability to use real Database so we used files with txt csv extensions to make it through, of course we are not reposible of the high complexitiy of writing and reading the data but for but for normal get methods its O(logn) :) ](#)

* [📑For the search algorithm we have two complexitys for this cuz the different of the looking for data and when searching with id its log(n ) but for wen serching with (Strings) its O(n) :(  ](#)

* [💻We dealed with the Main structers (user/books treeMaps and Hashmap) as A statics so we can invoke them in classes out of the RWDatabase class for make it easy on us. and there is refreshing reading/writing methods](#)
        
# 💻 Environment


This lib is a compnent for JavaFx:   [JavaFx](https://openjfx.io/)

We have a great workstation here, then I've using a maven  and Java and JavaFx +19 on Windows. (I really want to test in other systems in future).

# 🚀 WorkFlow

We split the work between us Eng.Baraa  take most of main interfaces and the book/users objects and the add/remove user/book cnotrollers structer.
And I Eng.Belal was working on the Search algorithms and tableViews details and the ui/ux styling and displaying the content of the right side panels and editing them.

should we mention that we used Git with our work, github make it easy to code without even see each oter it was really game changing and alot of skills we learnt in this chapter of out lifes.
