# üìë Techincal Contents

<!-- TOC -->
<h4>We used with this program fast dataStructers in searcing , adding , getting and editing data </h4>

***Important ::: note that the admin userId->1111 and the password->admin


* [üìë We have two Interfaces one for users and one for Admin and  ofcourse the login/Singup interface.](#-)

* [üíª We used slideBars for swtiching between panes with cool methods. ](#-)

* [üíªFor the users and the Books objects we used TreeMaps.](#-)

* [üìëHashMap with (key,value)->(Integer,LinkedList<>) to make a relation between users and the books they purchased.](#)
* [üíªwe dont have the ability to use real Database so we used files with txt csv extensions to make it through, of course we are not reposible of the high complexitiy of writing and reading the data but for but for normal get methods its O(logn) :) ](#)

* [üìëFor the search algorithm we have two complexitys for this cuz the different of the looking for data and when searching with id its log(n ) but for wen serching with (Strings) its O(n) :(  ](#)

* [üíªWe dealed with the Main structers (user/books treeMaps and Hashmap) as A statics so we can invoke them in classes out of the RWDatabase class for make it easy on us. and there is refreshing reading/writing methods](#)
